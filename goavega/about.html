    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <p>
      <i>
        Goavega is a portmanteau of Goa, one of India’s most happening states
        with both eastern and western cultural influence and Vega, one of the
        brightest stars in the space. Just like we combined the two words to
        create our identity, we combine the latest technologies, best practices,
        and global talent to help our customers grow their businesses.
